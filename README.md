# Multi-View-Geometry-Estimations
Assignment records for CSE 252B Computer Vision II<br><br>

Instructor: [Ben Ochoa](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~bochoa/)<br>
Python Version: 2.7.6<br><br>

This repository contains the codes for multiple multi-view geometry estimation tasks, including Camera Projection Matrix Estimation, Camera Pose Estimation, Planar Projective Transformation Estimation and Fundamental Matrix Estimation. For detail illustrations, please go to my [Blog](https://albuspeter.github.io/blog.html). Note: there may be minor bugs in the codes of Fundamental Matrix Estimation which cause the LM cost decreasing slow. If you find any bug, please let me know.
